# A/B Testing Simple

By A/B testing at the edge, you'll reduce layout shift from client-loaded experiments and improve your site's performance with smaller JavaScript bundles.

## Demo

https://edge-functions-ab-testing-simple.vercel.app

Since the different variants are generated statically at the edge, it mitigates any potential layout shift that could happen when a variant is inserted into the DOM client side, hence improving your site's performance.

Take a look at [`middleware.ts`](middleware.ts) to see how it works.

### One-Click Deploy

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=vercel-examples):

## Getting Started

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/edge-functions/ab-testing-simple ab-testing-simple
# or
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/edge-functions/ab-testing-simple ab-testing-simple
```

Next, run Next.js in development mode:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or

yarn
yarn dev
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=edge-middleware-eap) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).
